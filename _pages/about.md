I am a first year PhD student at Ecole des Ponts ParisTech [CERMICS](https://cermics-lab.enpc.fr/) under the supervision of [Axel Parmentier](https://cermics.enpc.fr/~parmenta/), in Machine Learning and Operations Research. My PhD thesis is part of an academic chair between Ecole des Ponts Paristech and Groupe Renault, and focuses on a large scale Inventory Routing Problem.
