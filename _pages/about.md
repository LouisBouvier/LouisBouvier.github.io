Welcome to my webpage!
I am a junior researcher and operational scientific manager at the [Co-innovation lab](https://ecoledesponts.fr/co-innovation-lab) of Ecole Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées. My time is shared between research (70%) and scientific consulting (30%) for the industry or public sector in operations research and machine learning. In particular, I am involved in a partnership between Ecole Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées and Renault Group Supply Chain.

Before that, I was a PhD student at Ecole Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées [CERMICS](https://cermics-lab.enpc.fr/) under the supervision of [Axel Parmentier](https://cermics.enpc.fr/~parmenta/), in machine learning and operations research. My PhD thesis was part of an academic collaboration between Ecole Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées and Renault Group, and focused on large-scale inventory routing problems.
